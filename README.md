### Hey there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Hand%20gestures/Waving%20Hand.png" alt="Waving Hand" width="25" height="25" />

I'm <a href= "www.lukababetzki.com">**Luka**</a>, a computer science graduate based in Manchester.

I build systems to understand how to break them.

Prototype fast, fine-tune later.

My main toolkit is Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit, and Hashcat. I write my own tools/scripts in Python and Bash.

I've got a bunch of pinned projects below, but my favourite is the <a href= "github.com/Luka-Babetzki/network-medic">Network Medic</a> tool.

You'll find me completing TryHackMe rooms and pwning HackTheBox labs.
