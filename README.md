### Hey there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Hand%20gestures/Waving%20Hand.png" alt="Waving Hand" width="25" height="25" />

I'm [**Luka**](www.lukababetzki.com), a computer science graduate based in Manchester.

I build systems to understand how to break them.

Prototype fast, fine-tune later.

My main toolkit is Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit, and Hashcat. I write my own tools/scripts in Python and Bash.

I've got a bunch of pinned projects below, but my favourite is the [Network Medic](github.com/Luka-Babetzki/network-medic) tool.

You'll find me completing TryHackMe rooms and pwning HackTheBox labs.

- I have a neuroscience degree
- *If Russia Wins* by Carlo Masala is my favourite book
- **Hobbies:** chess, film photography, rooting HTB machines
